# Predictions
## For the Record

1. 2021 will be worse than 2020. I'm sorry to say this. The virus will mutate.  People will start amassing thinking the worst is behind us. A lot of people will think that Biden will ride in in a red mustang and save us. Not going to happen.  We will need 10 years at least to fix what Drumpf broke.   Nature will find a way to restore the equilibirtium that too many humnans have upset on this planet.

2. Cyrptocurrency.  I'm not sure what is correct yet. But I think there will be at least a large swing in the price of bitcoin and by extension other crypto currencies. 31K +
