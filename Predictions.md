# Predictions
## For the Record - (Check the git commit history if you'd like)
### These predictions are for 2024, made on December 14, 2023. None of these predictions show my intent or desires about anything.  These are all gut feelings, I'd love to be wrong about many of them. 

1. The Middle East.  There will not be nuclear war, or the end of the world.  However, the fighting will not go as easily as expected for either side.  The humanitarian crises will get worse before it gets better.  This will also bleed into the surrounding countries of Egypt and Lebanon.  It is not going to be pretty for anyone unfortunately.  This will also spill out into other non-neighboring countries as angry people ramp up activism and terrorism in order to make their opinions known, in the least fruitful and beneficial ways possible. 
2. Ukraine - This war will also continue to grind on. While there is a lot of fear there as well, nukes won't be used.  There are cooler heads that will prevail and the risk of involving NATO in a more kinetic and official capacity will still prove daunting to Vlad. 
3. Aliens - This year (2023) started off with a lot hearsay testimony about the governments of the world hiding the existent of aliens.  (Not extraterrestrials, but unidentified aerial phenomena, nobody will put their neck out about that.)  Since the attention span of humans has been whittled down to 2 weeks due to the proliferation of swiping on social media, there aren’t a lot of people still paying attention to this story.  There will be more announcements, but anyone who is trying to make money or a reputation off of this story is too invested in it to tell the truth.  I would expect the can to be kicked down the road again - the new date will be 2027.  
4. Environmental Issues - I am a bit more optimistic about this one.  There are technological advances that could change the game, and while it might not be 2024 - there will be some good news on this front.  Also, I think there will be more of a shift to corporate environmental responsibility.
5. Bitcoin - First of all, I barely care about this now, but I think it should hit 65,000 before retreating by the end of 2024 temporarily.  All of this could change with quantum computing and it could spell the end of the currency by 2025.  So it could either run to 120,000 in 2025 or drastically fall.  I’ll make that prediction about 2025 at the end of 2024.
6. Cybersecurity - I think there will be more large scale hacks.  With the proliferation of AI, it will become easier to dupe people into giving up their information.  I don’t think that AI will “takeover” the world.  It is possible, but it is also possible to start unplugging data centers.  It is also possible that the cat is already out of the bag.  Furthermore, more attacks on SCADA systems will occur and power outages are possible.  
7. AI, see 6.
8. US elections, I think Trump will win again. The news cycle is focused on issues that will lead his followers to re-elect him. 

### These are old ones: from  Jan 21, 2021

1. 2021 will be worse than 2020. I'm sorry to say this. The virus will mutate.  People will start amassing thinking the worst is behind us. A lot of people will think that Biden will ride in in a red mustang and save us. Not going to happen.  We will need 10 years at least to fix what Drumpf broke.   Nature will find a way to restore the equilibirtium that too many humnans have upset on this planet.

2. Cryptocurrency.  I'm not sure what is correct yet. But I think there will be at least a large swing in the price of bitcoin and by extension other crypto currencies. 31K +
18K -
Althoiugh I am lenaing toward bitcoin hitting 50K realistiscally.  So today it is at 35%
